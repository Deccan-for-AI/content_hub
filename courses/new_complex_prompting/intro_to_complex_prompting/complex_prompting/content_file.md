:::tip
Complex prompting is an advanced way of interacting with AI by embedding context, constraints, roles, and multi-step logic into a single instruction. Unlike simple prompts, it challenges the model to reason, adapt, and synthesize like a human. Think of it as turning a basic task into a layered, creative problem; much like asking someone to bake a themed cake with dietary rules and detailed steps.

## <span style=""color:#364BC9"">Why Learn Complex Prompting?</span>

:::tip
Learning complex prompting is essential for evaluating models, as it reveals issues like hallucinations and skipped steps. Itâ€™s also key to creating high-quality datasets for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Additionally, it enables strong feedback loops by turning model failures into actionable insights.
