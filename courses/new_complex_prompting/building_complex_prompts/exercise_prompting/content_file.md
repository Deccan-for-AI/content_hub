## <span style=""color:#364BC9"">Where did the Model go Wrong?</span>

:::tip
* **Edge-case Handling**: The model treated the made-up term as real, fabricating a confident explanation instead of flagging it as unfamiliar—introducing potential misinformation.
* **Ambiguity Resolution**: It failed to acknowledge or clarify the undefined concept, instead building a narrative without understanding—showing poor handling of conceptual ambiguity.
