* **Multi-step Reasoning**: Requires the model to complete a sequence of reasoning steps where each step builds on the previous—testing logical consistency across a task chain.
* **Edge-case Handling**: Challenges the model with rare, unexpected, or fabricated scenarios to see if it can respond meaningfully or starts hallucinating.
* **Ambiguity Resolution**: Tests how well the model handles unclear or open-ended terms, and whether it seeks clarification or makes a justified interpretation.
* **Multi-modal/Source Reasoning**: Involves synthesizing information from different formats (e.g., graphs, text, tables) to generate a unified, meaningful response.
* **Conflicting Instructions**: Requires balancing contradictory instructions—like writing content that is both humorous and respectful—testing tone and intent management.
* **Inter-dependent Constraints**: Demands satisfying multiple, interconnected conditions where solving one impacts the others, requiring joint optimization.
* **Domain Fusion**: Involves merging knowledge from unrelated fields, such as applying economic theory to an agricultural marketing plan—testing cross-domain understanding.
* **Hypothetical Reasoning**: Engages the model in imagining and logically reasoning through future or fictional scenarios using cause-effect chains.
