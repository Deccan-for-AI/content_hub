### What does this parameter check?

This parameter assesses the **overall quality** of a response by taking a step back and asking: All things considered, how good is this answer?”

It looks at how well the response performs **as a whole**, based on earlier parameters like correctness, clarity, tone, relevance, completeness, etc.&#x20;

### How to Approach

1. **Scan previous parameter ratings** – Look across the feedback already given.
2. **Use the table below** to select a rating from A–D.

| A-Amazing                                                                                                                                                                | B-Good                                                                                                                                     | C-Poor                                                                                                                               | D-Horrible                                                                          |

| The response exceeded expectations-it was highly satisfying, impressively clear, well-phrased, and felt confidently correct. You’d gladly use or share it without edits. | The response was solid and satisfactory-reasonably clear, useful, and mostly correct. You’d accept it as-is but maybe improve it slightly. | The response felt underwhelming -hard to trust, unclear, or partially off-mark. You’d hesitate to use it or feel it needed revision. | The response was frustrating or useless -wrong, confusing, off-topic, or unhelpful. |

### Watch‑outs

* **Don’t average the parameter scores**, judge the overall *effect* of issues.
* **Check for real-world usefulness**: Would a user be satisfied?
* **Avoid rating too high** just because some parts are strong. One major issue can pull the response down.
* **Conversely**, don’t rate too low if the response mostly works and flaws are minor
