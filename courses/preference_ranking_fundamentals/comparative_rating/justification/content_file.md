Finally, you have to write a justification for the chosen rating on the Likert scale. This helps in understanding the rationale behind the ranking.

1. The justification has to be based on the metrics used to rate both the responses and provide evidence.
2. A good justification is thorough yet concise, consistent with the ranking and helps in improving the model.

:::tip
1) Start with the chosen rating: Begin the justification by clearly stating which response is better based on the Likert scale. Example: *"**Response 1 is better than Response 2 because...**"*
2) Evaluate both responses side by side, identifying the strengths of the better one and explaining *why* it stands out.
3) Address the criteria that were affected and *how it affected* the response quality.
4) Provide *suggestions for improvement,* offering concrete changes.
5) Mention the *expected outcome of improvement* suggested and how that would improve the user experience.
