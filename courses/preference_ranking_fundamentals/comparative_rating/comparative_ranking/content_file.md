After individually scoring responses, evaluators compare two responses directly using a 1â€“7 Likert scale, reflecting which is better and by how much, based on overall quality-not just isolated parameters.

**How to rate on Likert Scale?**

1. **Rate both responses individually** across the parameters
2. Make note of the Overall Response quality of both responses
3. Then, **compare the two responses overall** using the **Likert scale (1â€“7)**.
   * Refer back to the individual parameter scores when making your comparison.
   * This ensures your judgment is consistent and well-supported.

**ðŸ’¡ *The 1â€“7 Likert scale is a standard way to compare responses, widely used in evaluation settings.***
