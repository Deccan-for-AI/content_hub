**Letâ€™s look at our example document and create a good question:**&#x20;

<a href="https://www.unicef.org/media/157491/file/UNICEF%20Annual%20report%202023%20EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  UNICEF Annual Report 2023
</a>

Based on the sections we selected, **a good query** could be
