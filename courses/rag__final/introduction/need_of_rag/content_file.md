Imagine you ask the model to give you information about climate change and policies implemented to mitigate the same, and it responds by giving you either generic answers or information from 2020 that is not relevant anymore! For the model to provide you the latest data, it needs to be trained to access the latest and the most relevant data first. Weâ€™ll cover more on how to do this in the following sections.

Therefore, models trained in retrieving information provide high-quality responses that are accurate, evidence-based, and can incorporate updated information in its responses, making them relevant and useful. Most LLMs are trained with static datasets that are outdated or incomplete. RAG training bridges the gap between static data and dynamic, real-time information retrieval, making it a powerful and scalable solution for building intelligent applications.
