Finally, you have to write a justification for the chosen rating on the **Likert scale**. This helps in understanding the rationale behind the ranking.

1. The justification must be based on the **ratings of the responses** and provide supporting **evidence**.
2. A good justification is **thorough yet concise**, **aligned with the ranking**, and **helps in improving the model**.

### <span style="color:#8591FF">üîç Please keep the following in mind when writing a justification:</span>

1. **Start with the chosen rating**
   Begin by clearly stating which response is better based on the Likert scale.
   *Example: ""Response A is better than Response B because...""*
2. **Evaluate both responses side by side**
   Identify the **strengths** of the better response and explain **why** it stands out.
3. **Address affected criteria**
   Mention the relevant dimensions (e.g., Instruction Following, Factual Accuracy) and **how they influenced** the overall quality.
4. **Provide suggestions for improvement**
   Offer **specific, actionable** changes that could improve the weaker response.
5. **Mention expected outcome**
   Explain how the suggested improvements would **enhance the user experience** or align the model better with expectations.
