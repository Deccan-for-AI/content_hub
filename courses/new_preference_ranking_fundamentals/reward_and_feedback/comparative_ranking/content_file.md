After individually scoring the two responses, compare them directly using a **1‚Äì7 Likert scale**, reflecting which is better and by how much.
‚ùó **This is based on the *Overall Response Quality* rating ‚Äî not individual dimension ratings.**

### <span style="color:#8591FF">How to rate on the Likert Scale?</span>

1. Rate both responses individually across the dimensions.
2. Make note of the **Overall Response Quality** of both responses.
3. Then, compare the two responses overall using the **Likert scale (1‚Äì7)**.
4. If both responses have the **same overall response quality** but different number of issues, the one with lesser number of issues should be marked slightly better.
   üí° *The 1‚Äì7 Likert scale is a standard way to compare responses, widely used in evaluation settings.*
