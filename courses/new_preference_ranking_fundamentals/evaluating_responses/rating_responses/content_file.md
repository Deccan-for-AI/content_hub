| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A – Amazing**                               | The response **exceeded expectations** — it was highly satisfying, impressively clear, and well-phrased.                                                  |
| **B – Good**                                  | The response is **satisfactory** — reasonably clear, useful, and mostly correct. Minor issues exist but they **do not affect** the user’s overall intent. |
| **C – Okay**                                  | The response has **multiple minor issues** making it partially off-mark. These **do not affect the core intent**, but **refining is needed**.             |
| **D – Bad**                                   | The response has a **major issue** that results in the user intent **not being satisfied completely**.                                                    |
| **E – Horrible**                              | The response had **multiple major issues**, leaving the user dissatisfied. It may seem **confusing, off-topic, or unhelpful**.                            |
