## <span style="color:#364BC9">Collaborativity</span>

Evaluates how well the model acts as an assistant to the user through clarifications, giving suggestions or supporting iterative interaction wherever required.

### <span style="color:#8591FF"> What does this parameter check?</span>

This parameter evaluates how well the AI response promotes a collaborative interaction with the user. It
checks if the response:

1. Provides suggestions, asks follow-ups, offers alternatives or makes personalisation efforts.
2. Maintains the flow of the conversation

❗Collaborativity is not required on all questions. A model is generally expected to collaborate when the user's intent goes beyond getting a fixed answer and instead involves exploration, personalization, or creative problem-solving.
