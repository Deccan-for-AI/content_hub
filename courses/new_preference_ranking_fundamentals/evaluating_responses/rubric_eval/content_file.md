When comparing two or more outputs from an AI system (such as a language model), a **rubric** helps human evaluators make consistent, informed decisions about **which response is better** â€” and *why*. A *rubric* is a **structured evaluation guide** consisting of several dimensions used to evaluate or score a response based on specific criteria.

In simple words, a rubric tells you:

* **What to look for** in a response (e.g., completeness, relevance, accuracy)
* **How to judge it** (e.g., no issues, minor issues, major issues)
* **Why it matters** (how it impacts quality or user satisfaction)
