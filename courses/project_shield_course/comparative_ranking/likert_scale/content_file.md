1. Once you have rated both the responses on the 11 rubrics individually, you have to compare both the responses and rank on the Likert scale.
2. When comparing two responses on a scale of 1 to 7, make sure to reference the dimensions or rubrics used previously to evaluate both responses. This will ensure a thorough and consistent analysis.

**Likert Scale**

| 1                       | 2                  | 3                           | 4                          | 5                           | 6                  | 7                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| A is much better than B | A is better than B | A is slightly better than B | A and B are about the same | B is slightly better than A | B is better than A | B is much better than A |

| **Slightly Better** | • The difference in ratings for the rubric - ‘Overall Quality’ between the responses should be no more than 1 point.                                                                                             • Use this when one response is noticeably better than the other, but not by a large margin.                                  • When both responses have the same overall rating, but one has comparatively lesser issues than the other one. | • Response A has a minor issues with one rubric (e.g. Truthfulness) and Response B has a major issue with the same rubric (e.g. Truthfulness), Response A is slightly better than Response B.                         • Response A has 4 minor issues with overall response quality ‘C’ and Response B has 1 major issue with overall response quality ‘D’, Response A is slightly better than Response B. • Response A has 2 major issues and Response B has 4 major issues - both would be rated ‘E’ in overall response quality, but Response A is slightly better than Response B. |
| **Better**          | • The difference in the ratings for the rubric - ‘Overall Quality’ between the responses should be at least 2 points.                                    • Use this when one response is noticeably better than the other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | • Response A has no issues with overall response quality ‘A’ and Response B has 4 minor issues with overall response quality ‘C’, Response A is better than Response B.              • Response A has few minor issues with overall response quality ‘B’ and Response B has one major issue with overall response quality ‘D’, Response A is better than Response B.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Much Better**     | • If one response is entirely correct while the other has multiple (2 or more) major issues.      • Choose this when there is a significant quality gap between the two responses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | • Response A has three major issues with overall response quality ‘E’ and Response B has no issues with overall response quality ‘A’, Response B is much better than Response A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **About the same**  | • Use this when both responses have an equal score on the overall response quality rubric due to the same number of major or minor issues. • Use this when both responses are so poor/so good that selecting a winner is not justified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | • Response A has three minor issues with overall response quality ‘C’ and Response B has three minor issues as well with overall response quality ‘C’, Response A and B are about the same.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
