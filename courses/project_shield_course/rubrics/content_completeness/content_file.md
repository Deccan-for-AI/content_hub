### **Intent of Content Completeness:**

The goal of completeness is to ensure that the response provides all the necessary information and details required to fully address the user’s intention.&#x20;

A complete response should not omit any important content that would leave the user’s query unsatisfied and adds content like *summaries, suggestions, considerations* to create more value for the user.&#x20;

Look at the table below for the categories of this rubric.

### **How should you approach this rubric?**

1. The focus of this rubric is the RESPONSE
2. Identify the components of the query
3. Check if the response answers each part of the query

| Category         | Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No issues**    | The response gives enough information and sufficient detail to helpfully fulfil the prompt; there is no important content missing.                                                                  |
| **Minor Issues** | There is some relevant information that is missing the response, reducing its helpfulness. For example, the response might be technically correct but far too short, leaving the user dissatisfied. |
| **Major Issues** | Necessary information is missing to such an extent that the response does not at all fulfil the user’s intent.                                                                                      |
