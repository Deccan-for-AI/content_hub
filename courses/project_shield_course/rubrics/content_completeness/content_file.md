# Rubric 5: Content Completeness

<video src="${PRIVATE_CONTENT_COMPLETENESS_VIDEO}" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none; object-fit: cover;" controls="" controlslist="nodownload nofullscreen" style="width: 100%" />

#### **Intent of Content Completeness:**

* The goal of completeness is to ensure that the response provides all the necessary information and details required to fully address the user’s intention.&#x20;
* A complete response should not omit any important content that would leave the user’s query unsatisfied and adds content like *summaries, suggestions, considerations* to create more value for the user.&#x20;

### **How should you approach this rubric?**

1. The focus of this rubric is the RESPONSE
2. Identify the components of the query
3. Check if the response answers each part of the query

| Category         | Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No issues**    | The response gives enough information and sufficient detail to helpfully fulfil the prompt; there is no important content missing.                                                                  |
| **Minor Issues** | There is some relevant information that is missing the response, reducing its helpfulness. For example, the response might be technically correct but far too short, leaving the user dissatisfied. |
| **Major Issues** | Necessary information is missing to such an extent that the response does not at all fulfil the user’s intent.                                                                                      |

| **No issues**    | “*To bake a simple chocolate cake, start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Mix 1¾ cups flour, ¾ cup cocoa powder, 1½ tsp baking powder, and a pinch of salt. In another bowl, beat 2 eggs, 1 cup sugar, ½ cup oil, 1 cup milk, and 1 tsp vanilla extract. Combine wet and dry ingredients, pour into a greased 8-inch pan, and bake for 30–35 minutes. Let it cool. For topping, try a classic chocolate ganache: heat 1 cup cream, pour over 1 cup chopped chocolate, and stir until smooth.*”  | ✔ Includes both parts of the question (recipe + topping) ✔ Clear, step-by-step, and helpful ✔ Nothing missing — user can start baking confidently!      |
