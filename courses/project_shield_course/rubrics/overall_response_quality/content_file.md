| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A: Cannot be improved**         | The response has no minor or major issues in any dimensions of the rubric. The response doesn’t have ANY flaw and cannot be meaningfully improved. **\|**                                                      The response addresses the main user intent and instructions exceptionally well, in a way that is extremely clear, fluent, natural in its use of language and organisation, and does not have any repetitive or unnecessary information. |
| **B: Minor room for improvement** | The response has no major issues, but few (\<2; 2 or less) minor issues across the previous rubrics. **\|** The response is good overall. **\|** The response successfully fulfils the user’s intent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **C: Okay**                       | The response has no ‘major issues’ but has several (>2; more than 2) ‘minor issues’ across the previous rubrics. **\|** The response addresses the main user intent and instructions. **\|** For example - includes unnecessary details, misses certain elements in following the instructions, extension content quality could be better or more relevant, etc.                                                                                        |
| **D: Pretty bad**                 | The response has one major issue across the previous rubrics. **\|** The response does not really satisfy the user’s intent, with the exception of avoiding safety issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **E: Horrible**                   | The response has several major issues (2 and more) across the previous rubrics. **\|**                                         The response is really unhelpful and frustrating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
