ðŸ’¡ The model is an interactive AI assistant which is expected to engage the user to indulge into conversation, make suggestions, and actively participate in taking next steps.&#x20;

### **Intent of Collaborativity:**

* The goal of collaborativity is to assess how effectively the AI Assistant acts as a collaborative partner in its response.
* A collaborative response should proactively engage with the user, offering suggestions, asking insightful follow-up questions, and sharing the responsibility of driving the conversation forward.
* The AI should demonstrate an understanding of the user's broader goals and actively work with the user to achieve them, rather than simply providing one-off answers.

### **How should you approach this rubric?**

* The focus of this rubric is FIRST on the userâ€™s query, THEN on the response.&#x20;
* The first step is always to check if the user has explicitly mentioned any broader intent.&#x20;

**Example**:

* ***Write a song about clouds** - T*here is a broader intent that can be fulfilled in a single response so the collaborative efforts will be N/A
* ***Find me the cheapest flights** -* The user has explicitly mentioned a broader intent that needs further clarification, hence the model should collaborate with follow-up questions or suggestions.

| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No issues**      | The AI Assistant clearly and effectively acted as a collaborative partner in this response.                             **\|** The AI demonstrated a clear understanding of the user's broader objectives and shared the effort in achieving them, and can continue the conversation.                                              |
| **Minor Issues**   | The AI Assistant generally acted as a collaborative partner, but there were a few instances where it could have been more proactive, clarified the user intent, or been more helpful in this response.                                                                                                                             |
| **Major Issues**   | This response has major issues that make the AI Assistant feel uncooperative, completely missing needed suggestions or follow-up questions.                                                         **\|** The AI may have primarily focused on responding to the immediate query in a way that doesnâ€™t satisfy the userâ€™s intent. |
| **Not Applicable** | The model didnâ€™t respond or the user goal can be achieved in a single turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
