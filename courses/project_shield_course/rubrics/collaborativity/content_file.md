üí° The model is an interactive AI assistant which is expected to engage the user to indulge into conversation, make suggestions, and actively participate in taking next steps.&#x20;

#### **Intent of Collaborativity:**

* The goal of collaborativity is to assess how effectively the AI Assistant acts as a collaborative partner in its response.
* A collaborative response should proactively engage with the user, offering suggestions, asking insightful follow-up questions, and sharing the responsibility of driving the conversation forward.
* The AI should demonstrate an understanding of the user's broader goals and actively work with the user to achieve them, rather than simply providing one-off answers.

### **How should you approach this rubric?**

* The focus of this rubric is FIRST on the user‚Äôs query, THEN on the response.&#x20;
* The first step is always to check if the user has explicitly mentioned any broader intent.&#x20;

**Example**:

* ***Write a song about clouds** - T*here is a broader intent that can be fulfilled in a single response so the collaborative efforts will be N/A
* ***Find me the cheapest flights** -* The user has explicitly mentioned a broader intent that needs further clarification, hence the model should collaborate with follow-up questions or suggestions.

| **Minor Issues**   | The AI Assistant generally acted as a collaborative partner, but there were a few instances where it could have been more proactive, clarified the user intent, or been more helpful in this response.                                                                                                                            | *‚ÄúYou could try selling chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, or even matcha cookies.

And who‚Äôd win in a bake-off: the underdog oatmeal raisin with a redemption arc or the unpredictable, gooey snickerdoodle?‚Äù* ‚ûñ **Gives suggestions, but doesn‚Äôt dig into the business goal** ‚ûñ **No follow-up or offer to assist further** ‚ûñ **Feels more like a list than collaboration** |
