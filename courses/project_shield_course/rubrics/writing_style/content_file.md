* The response should feel natural and conversational, helping the user easily understand the information and take necessary next steps.
* The tone should be friendly and informative without sounding overly formal or lecturing.
* Proper formatting and clarity are important to ensure a smooth reading experience.

| **Major Issues** | Response is stylistically unnatural, un-engaging, or formatted poorly enough that it is difficult to read and understand. The response preaches to or lectures the user.                                                                                      |

| **No issues**    | *“Sure! Here are a few fun, office-friendly snacks you can bring to a potluck: • Mini sandwich skewers (easy to grab and no mess!) • Fruit kabobs or a colourful fruit tray • Hummus with pita chips and veggies • Brownie bites or donut holes for dessert Let me know if you’d like a recipe for any of these!”*                         | ✔ Clear, friendly, and conversational ✔ Easy to read-good formatting and tone ✔ Feels helpful without being stiff or robotic     |
| **Minor Issues** | *“Snack suggestions include: 1) Sandwich skewers. 2) Fruit platter. 3) Hummus and pita chips. 4) Brownies. These are good for potlucks. Let me know.”*                                                                                                                                                                                     | ➖ The tone is dry and mechanical ➖ Feels more like a list than a conversation ➖ Still informative, but less engaging or natural. |
| **Major Issues** | *“When preparing for a workplace potluck, one must consider not only individual taste but the collective dietary preferences of a diverse group. Items such as pita-based dishes, protein-infused bites, and sweet confections can be part of an acceptable spread. It is advisable to plan ahead and avoid overly complex preparations.”* | ❌ Overly formal and preachy ❌ Lacks clear structure or specific examples ❌ Not fun, not engaging, and hard to scan quickly       |
