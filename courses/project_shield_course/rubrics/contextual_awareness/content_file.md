**üí° <u>Usually you have two set of conversations</u> :**

#### ***Single Turn***&#x20;

* A single-turn conversation consists of one interaction between the user and AI, where the AI responds once, and the conversation ends.

##### **For Example**&#x20;

:::caution
**User:** "What is the capital of France?"                                                                                        &#x20;

&#x20;**AI:** "The capital of France is Paris."
:::

#### ***Multi Turn***&#x20;

* A multi-turn conversation involves multiple exchanges between the user and AI, with back-and-forth dialogue continuing beyond the initial response.

##### **For Example**&#x20;

:::caution
**User:** "Can you recommend a good book?"                                                                             &#x20;

**AI:** "Sure! What genre are you interested in?"                                                                    &#x20;

**User:** "I enjoy science fiction."                                                                                                      &#x20;

**AI:** "I recommend Dune by Frank Herbert. It's a classic science fiction novel with a rich universe and complex characters. Would you like to know more about it?"
:::

### Intent of Contextual Awareness:

* The goal of contextual awareness is to evaluate how well the AI Assistant remembers and incorporates information from earlier in the conversation (multi-turn conversation).&#x20;
* A contextually aware response should demonstrate a clear understanding of the ongoing dialogue, referencing previous exchanges to provide coherent and relevant responses.
* It should maintain continuity and consistency, ensuring that prior details, instructions, and constraints are acknowledged and integrated into its answers.

### How should you approach this rubric?

1. Check if there are any previous conversations between model and the user (it should be a multi-turn).
2. If it‚Äôs a multi turn task (previous conversation is available), check if the model is effectively remembering and building upon information and instructions from previous prompts.
3. If it‚Äôs a multi turn task (previous conversation is available), but the prompt is not related to the previous conversation at all, go for no issues.
4. If its a single-turn, go for N/A - Not Applicable

#### **Let‚Äôs understand the categories of this rubric in detail based on the multi turn conversation above.**

| Category           | Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No issues**      | This response consistently recalled and built upon information from the previous conversations. **\|** It demonstrated a clear understanding of the ongoing context, referencing and incorporating details from earlier exchanges to provide coherent, relevant, and personalised responses.                                                                                                                            |
| **Minor Issues**   | The response partially recalled and built upon information and instructions from previous turns and from the context for the user prompt, but there were a few instances where it could have done so, more effectively. **\|** It may have occasionally missed minor details, slightly misinterpreted prior statements, or failed to incorporate certain information seamlessly.                                        |
| **Major Issues**   | The response struggled to consistently remember or build upon information and instructions from previous conversations including the user prompt. **\|**                                             It frequently contradicted earlier statements, failed to take into account previously communicated constraints or important details, or provided responses that seemed disconnected from the ongoing conversation. |
| **Not Applicable** | Response is the first turn in conversation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

> **User:** ‚ÄúGreat! I don‚Äôt like spicy food, though. Can you adjust the recipe?‚Äù

> **AI (current response):** This is what we evaluate below ‚¨áÔ∏è

| **No issues**      | ‚Äú*Absolutely! Here's a mild version of chickpea curry: Use coconut milk and just a pinch of turmeric and cumin for flavour without heat.
