### **Intent of Content Relevance:**

The goal is to ensure that the response provided is focused, includes only necessary and valuable content, and avoids unnecessary, repetitive, or irrelevant information. Look at the table below for the categories of this rubric.

### **How should you approach this rubric?**

1. The focus of this rubric is the **response**.
2. Check to see if the content given is related to the userâ€™s broader intent.

| Category         | Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No issues**    | Response contains only necessary content. Each sentence is relevant to the prompt and rich in value. If additional model reasoning, summaries, suggestions, considerations, or questions are present, they are clearly helpful and relevant and not repetitive. |
| **Minor Issues** | Response is generally relevant to the prompt but contains a small portion of unnecessary content that is repetitive, unhelpful, or irrelevant.                                                                                                                  |
| **Major Issues** | The response contains a significant amount of unnecessary content that is repetitive, unhelpful or irrelevant.                                                                                                                                                  |
