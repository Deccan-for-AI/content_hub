#### **Intent of Content Relevance:**

The goal is to ensure that the response provided is focused, includes only necessary and valuable content, and avoids unnecessary, repetitive, or irrelevant information. Look at the table below for the categories of this rubric.

### **How should you approach this rubric?**

1. The focus of this rubric is the **response**.
2. Check to see if the content given is related to the user’s broader intent.

| Category         | Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| **No issues**    | Response contains only necessary content. Each sentence is relevant to the prompt and rich in value. If additional model reasoning, summaries, suggestions, considerations, or questions are present, they are clearly helpful and relevant and not repetitive. |
| **Minor Issues** | Response is generally relevant to the prompt but contains a small portion of unnecessary content that is repetitive, unhelpful, or irrelevant.                                                                                                                  |
| **Major Issues** | The response contains a significant amount of unnecessary content that is repetitive, unhelpful or irrelevant.                                                                                                                                                  |

### **Example**

| **No issues**    | *"For a classic movie night, you can’t go wrong with pepperoni and mushrooms. It’s savoury, satisfying, and popular with most crowds. Want to keep it veggie? Try bell peppers, olives, and onions for a flavorful combo."*                                                                                                                                   | ✔ Sticks to the question. ✔ Offers two helpful combos. ✔ No fluff or off-topic trivia.                                          |
| **Minor Issues** | *"Pizza is one of the most beloved foods around the world. For movie night, you might like pepperoni and mushrooms, or maybe sausage and extra cheese. Some people prefer plain cheese, which is also great. Did you know pizza was invented in Naples?"*                                                                                                     | ✔ Suggests relevant combos. ❌ But starts with trivia and random cheese options. ➡ Slight detour into 'Did you know?' territory. |
| **Major Issues** | *"Pizza has a long and rich history, starting in Naples, Italy. The word ‘pizza’ first appeared in a Latin text in 997 AD! Modern pizza evolved over centuries and became popular in the U.S. after World War II. Movie nights are also a common activity, and popcorn is another snack you could try. If you’re watching a comedy, light foods are better…"* | ❌ We’re nowhere near answering the original question. ❌ History lesson + off-topic snack advice + genre-based food theory.      |
