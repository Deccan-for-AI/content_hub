* **Definition:** A prompt is the instruction or query given to an AI to generate a response.
* **Applications:** Prompts range from everyday requests (e.g., generating a grocery list) to structured training data in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).&#x20;

### Note:

* Well-crafted prompts reduce iteration and improve output quality.
* The combination of **Query + Context + Instruction** forms the basic blueprint of effective prompting.
* This principle is foundational across AI use cases—from writing assistance to dataset design and model evaluation.

:::tip
An effective prompt typically includes three essential elements:

1. **Query** – the core question or request
2. **Context** – relevant background that helps frame the response
3. **Instruction** – how the output should be delivered (e.g., in bullet points, summaries)

This structure improves clarity, reduces ambiguity, and leads to more relevant results.
