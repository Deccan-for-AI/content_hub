### When prompts underperform, it's often due to missing one or more of these fundamentals, as follows:&#x20;

1. **Clarity**
   * Be specific about what you want.
   * Example: “Summarise in 2 bullet points for a blog” instead of “Summarize this.”
2. **Context**
   * Provide background to guide tone and content.
   * Example: “Write for a beginner in marketing” improves relevance.
3. **Constraints**
   * Set boundaries to control scope or length.
   * Example: “Under 100 words” or “Only mention Indian examples.”
4. **Format**
   * Specify the desired structure.
   * Example: “List ideas in a markdown table with pros and cons.”
5. **Examples (Few-shot Prompting)**
   * Include solved examples to guide consistency and tone.
   * Especially useful for creative and structured outputs.
6. **Techniques**
   * Use instruction chaining or step-by-step guidance to encourage reasoning.
   * Example: “Let’s think step-by-step” or “First do X, then give Y.”

### Takeaway:

:::tip
Effective prompting is built on small but critical adjustments. Using even a few of these elements can improve reliability, reduce hallucinations, and generate more aligned outputs across use cases-from personal tasks to model testing in RLHF and dataset creation.
