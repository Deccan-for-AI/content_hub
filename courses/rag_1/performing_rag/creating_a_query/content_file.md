# Framing good questions

A high-quality question is one that includes multiple sub-questions and references information from various sections of the document. When framing such a question, it should be structured like a userâ€™s natural query to an assistant.

## Take Home Assigment

Create multiple questions from the document in use as the working example. Create a mix of good questions and poor questions. Learners need to distinguish between them and provide reasoning.
