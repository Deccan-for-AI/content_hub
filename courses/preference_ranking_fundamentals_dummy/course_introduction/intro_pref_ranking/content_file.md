## <span style="color:#364BC9">What is Preference Ranking and Where Does it Come Into Play?</span>

**RLHF uses preference ranking as a core component** to train Large Language Models. Preference Ranking is a method where human evaluators compare multiple AI-generated responses to a given prompt according to specific dimensions and rank one of the two responses to be a better one. Preference Ranking helps identify responses that humans prefer, directly influencing how the model learns and improves over time.

## <span style="color:#364BC9">Where Do You Come Into the Process?</span>

Human evaluators assess model responses and evaluate their quality against clearly defined dimensions. Based on the evaluations, feedback is provided to the model to enhance its performance. This direct human involvement ensures that the resulting AI systems remain responsive, relevant, and safe for real-world applications.

In this task, you’ll step into the role of a critical evaluator, reviewing **two AI-generated responses** to a single user prompt.

**Step 1: Start with the user’s intent**
Start by carefully reading the user prompt. Go beyond the literal request—try to understand the user's **underlying goal** and **context**.

**Step 2: Evaluate model responses**
After reviewing the prompt, the next step is to evaluate each response separately. Each one must be rated across all the dimensions given. The criteria for assigning ratings are nuanced and should be read carefully to ensure accurate and consistent evaluation throughout the task.

**Step 3: Comparative Ranking on the Likert Scale**
Once both responses have been evaluated, rate them **relative to each other** using a **1–7 Likert scale**.

**Step 4: Justify your reasoning**
Conclude by writing an **effective justification** for your chosen score. This is one of the most critical parts of the process, as it reflects your analytical reasoning and highlights what made one response stronger (or why both were equal). Refer to justification writing guidelines.
