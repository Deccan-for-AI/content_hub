## <span style="color:#364BC9">Collaborativity</span>

<div style="border: 4px solid #d0f3f7; border-radius: 10px; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px; background-color: #d0f3f7; color: #000000">Evaluates how well the model acts as an assistant to the user through clarifications, giving suggestions or supporting iterative interaction wherever required.</div>

<span style="color:#000000">**What does this dimension check?**</span>

This dimension evaluates how well the AI response promotes a collaborative interaction with the user. It checks if the response:
1\. Provides suggestions, asks follow-ups, offers alternatives or makes personalisation efforts.
2\. Maintains the flow of the conversation

❗Collaborativity is not required on all questions. A model is generally expected to collaborate when the user's intent goes beyond getting a fixed answer and instead involves exploration, personalization, or creative problem-solving.
