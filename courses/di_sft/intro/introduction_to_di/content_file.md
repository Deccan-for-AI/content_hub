Imagine you're a researcher trying to make sense of complex data from various charts, tables, infographics, or presentation slides, but you don’t have expertise to read through the statistical data. 

Do you enjoy the struggle of deciphering these visuals on your own, or would you prefer an intelligent assistant that interprets the data for you, identifies trends, patterns, relationships, and anomalies, and provides meaningful insights in simple language?
