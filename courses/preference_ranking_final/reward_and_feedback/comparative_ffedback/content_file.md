## <span style="color:#364BC9">How to rate on the Likert Scale?</span>

1. Rate both responses individually across the dimensions.
2. Make note of the **Overall Response Quality** of both responses.
3. Then, compare the two responses overall using the **Likert scale (1–7)**.
4. If both responses have the **same overall response quality** but different number of issues, the one with lesser number of issues should be marked slightly better.

❗ This is based on the Overall Response Quality rating — not individual dimension ratings.
💡 The 1–7 Likert scale is a standard way to compare responses, widely used in evaluation settings.
