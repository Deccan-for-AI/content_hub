### 📌 What is AI?  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines. These machines are designed to think, learn, and make decisions, much like a human brain. AI enables computers to **process large amounts of data**, **recognize patterns**, and **perform complex tasks** with minimal human intervention.  

At its core, AI involves **algorithms**, **mathematical models**, and **computational techniques** that allow machines to mimic human cognitive functions. AI systems can be **rule-based** (explicitly programmed) or **learning-based** (using data to improve performance).

### 📖 A Brief History of AI  

🔹 **1950s – The Birth of AI**  
- Alan Turing introduces the **Turing Test**, a way to determine a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior.  
- The term *Artificial Intelligence* was coined by **John McCarthy** in 1956.  

🔹 **1970s-1980s – Expert Systems and Early Research**  
- AI research shifts toward **rule-based expert systems** used in medical diagnosis and finance.  
- Limited computing power and funding cause the **AI Winter**, a period of reduced research progress.  

🔹 **1990s-2000s – Machine Learning & Internet Boom**  
- AI advances with **neural networks** and **big data processing**.  
- IBM’s **Deep Blue** defeats world chess champion **Garry Kasparov** in 1997.  

🔹 **2010s-Present – Deep Learning & Real-World AI**  
- AI breakthroughs include **self-driving cars, voice assistants (Siri, Alexa), and facial recognition**.  
- AI now powers **healthcare diagnostics, personalized recommendations, and robotics**.

### 🔎 How Does AI Work?

AI systems function by **collecting data, analyzing patterns, and making decisions** based on that information. The **AI process** typically follows these steps:

1️⃣ **Data Collection** – AI gathers raw data from sensors, text, images, or user interactions.
2️⃣ **Data Processing** – The collected data is cleaned and structured for analysis.
3️⃣ **Model Training** – Machine Learning algorithms learn from the data to recognize patterns.
4️⃣ **Decision Making** – AI makes predictions or decisions based on learned patterns.
5️⃣ **Continuous Improvement** – AI refines its knowledge using feedback loops.
