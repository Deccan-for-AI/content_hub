1. Narrow AI (Weak AI) – AI specialized for a single task (e.g., Chatbots, Siri)
2. General AI (Strong AI) – AI with human-like reasoning (not yet achieved)
3. Super AI – AI surpassing human intelligence (theoretical)

🔹 Based on Functionality:

1. Reactive Machines – No memory, reacts to situations (e.g., IBM’s Deep Blue)
2. Limited Memory – Learns from past data (e.g., Self-driving cars)
3. Theory of Mind – AI that understands emotions (future concept)
4. Self-aware AI – AI with its own consciousness (theoretical)
